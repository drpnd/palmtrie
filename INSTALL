The distribution package includes the `configure' script to generate `Makefile'.
If you build this software from the repository, run `./autogen.sh' to generate
the `configure' script.

Run the following command to build this software programs.

    $ ./configure && make

This command builds the following test programs and palmtrie library (see APIs
section in `README.md' for the library interfaces).

    * palmtrie_test_basic
    * palmtrie_test_acl
    * palmtrie_eval_lpm
    * palmtrie_eval_acl
    * libpalmtrie.la

The `Makefile' supports installation these binary programs and the library
with the following command.

    $ make install

Note that the installation is not required in most cases because the binary
programs are for testing and evaluation and only the `libpalmtrie.la' library
is needed.
